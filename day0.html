	<h1>Day Zero</h1>
    
      <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>The trip starts in the familiar city of Lowell, very close to the UMass Lowell campuses. Lots of time was spent
          booking hotels, looking up restaurants, calculating travel times, buying necessary items, and packing everything
          that was needed. This was definitely the least fun part of the trip but there was no avoiding it.</p>

            Also sorry for the unflattering image Bean... you just look so goofy...</p>

        <p>There isn't much more to say about this day, so let's move on the actual trip!</p>
