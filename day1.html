	<h1>Day One</h1>
    <h2>Destination</h2>
      <p>The destination for day one was Cresco, Pennsylvania. This would be my first time visiting western Massachusetts,
        New York state outside of New York City, and Pennsylvania. One our way to Cresco, a stop was made in Great Barrington, MA to visit a friend and get lunch, and then there was a long drive to Port Jervis, NY, and the nearby scenic route up to the Hawk's Nest Lookout.
        After nearly getting lost due to a lack of cell service, the next stop was in Hawley, PA to get dinner. Subsequently I drove us to the wrong location of the hotel chain, which added about an hour to the journey.
        We finally got to my final destination in Cresco long after the sun had gone down.

    <h2><a href="restaurants.html">Restaurants</a></h2>
      <p>In Great Barrington, MA we ate at <a href="https://www.babalouiespizza.com/" target="_blank">Baba Louie's</a>, where I enjoyed a delicious pizza.
        In Hawley, PA we stopped at <a href="https://www.theboathouserestaurant.net/" target="_blank">The Boat House</a>, where the burger I got was a bit underwhelming,
        but I was just happy to get some food at that point.</p>
