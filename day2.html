	<h1>Day Two</h1>
    <h2>Destination</h2>
      <p>On Day Two we headed for Berkeley Springs, WV. I was now truly entering uncharted territory, having never been in any of the states I drove through before this road trip.
        We stopped at what was billed as a giant pothole in Scranton before grabbing some food. We then visited the abandoned iron furnaces, which were rather intimidating.
        This was followed by a bit of an unconventional stop at Bass Pro Shops near Harrisburg, PA, it was a giant retail location full of anything outdoors you could imagine.
        To balance out the huge Bass Pro Shop, we then visited Tiny World in Shippensburg, PA, a miniature town inhabited by some cats.
        After having dinner in Hagerstown, PA, we drove to West Virginia to check into Coolfont Resort, where we were going to stay for two nights.

    <h2><a href="restaurants.html">Restaurants</a></h2>
      <p>In Scranton, PA we had brunch at <a href="https://forknbowl.com/" target="_blank">Fork &amp; Bowl</a>, unfortunately the bowl I got ended up being a bit too spicy...
      For dinner we ate some Bavarian food at the <a href="https://schmankerlstube.com/" target="_blank">Schmankerlstube</a> in Hagerstown, PA.
      I really enjoyed this meal and it reminded me a bit of home.</p>
